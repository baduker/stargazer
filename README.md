Welcome to Stargazer, your command-line sidekick for navigating the cosmos of 
your starred GitHub repositories! ðŸŒŸðŸš€

With Stargazer, you can effortlessly browse through your starred projects, 
using a range of features designed to make your exploration both productive and 
enjoyable. Here's what Stargazer offers:

## Features, kind of. This is more of a roadmap. :D

- **Paged Browsing**: Navigate through your stars with ease, with each page 
showing essential info such as the programming language, a brief description, 
the number of stars, and the last update date.

- **Filtering System**: Hone in on what you need by filtering repositories by 
type (e.g., public, private, forks) and/or language (e.g., JavaScript, Python).

- **Sorting Sorcery**: Organize your view by recently starred repositories, 
those with the most activity, or the celestial bodies with the most stars.

- **Fuzzy Search**: Not quite sure what you're looking for? Use our fuzzy 
search to find repositories by typing in approximate names or topics.
